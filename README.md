Business Analytics Internship
Project Overview
This project aims to understand and visualise the dataset structure, analyze and build a model to determine the investment choices. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and training a machine learning model for prediction.

Project Description
The project involves the following tasks:

Task 1: Data Overview

Objective: Understand the dataset structure.

Steps:

data analysis tool such as Python with pandas or spreadsheet software.
Descriptive Statistics: Use descriptive functions (e.g., info() in pandas) to gather information about the number of entries, columns, and data types.

Task 2: Gender Distribution

Objective: Visualize gender distribution in the dataset.

Steps:

Extract Gender Information: Identify and extract the gender column from the dataset.
Visualization: Create a simple visualization, such as a bar chart or pie chart, to represent the distribution of genders in the dataset.
[Level 2: Intermediate]

Task 3: Descriptive Statistics

Objective: Present basic statistics for numerical columns.

Steps:

Identify Numerical Columns: Review the dataset to identify columns containing numerical data (e.g., age, income).
Calculations: Use statistical functions (e.g., mean(), median(), std()) to calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation for each numerical column.

Task 4: Most Preferred Investment Avenue
Objective: Identify the most preferred investment avenue.
Steps:

Analyze Investment Avenues: Examine thecolumn containing information about different investment avenues (e.g., equity, mutual funds).
Frequency Analysis: Determine the investment avenue with the highest frequency or occurrence.

Task 5: Reasons for Investment

Objective: Analyze and summarize reasons for investment choices.

Steps:

Explore Reasons Column: Investigate the column where participants provided reasons for their investment choices.
Summarize Reasons: Identify common themes or recurring reasons and provide a summary.
[Level 4: Expert]

Task 7: Common Information Sources

Objective: Analyze common sources participants rely on for investment information.

Steps:

Explore Information Sources Column: Review the column where participants indicated their sources of investment information.
Identify Common Sources: Analyze the data to identify and summarize the most common sources participants rely on.
Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for data manipulation and visualization.

Jupyter Notebook: Interactive computing environment for writing and running code.

Pandas: Data manipulation library.

Matplotlib: Visualization library for creating static plots.

Seaborn: Statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib.
